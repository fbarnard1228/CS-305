Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

In order to safeguard confidential information and adhere to industry norms, Artemis Financial, a financial services organization, had to improve the security of their online platforms. They needed a way to find and fix vulnerabilities in their software dependencies, data integrity checks to stop unwanted changes, and the deployment of HTTPS for secure communication. We enhanced their online services' dependability and security by attending to these needs.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I successfully applied data integrity checks, deployed HTTPS, and performed vulnerability assessment using the OWASP Dependency Check to fix Artemis Financial's software security flaws. Secure coding is essential for maintaining integrity, preventing breaches, and safeguarding sensitive data. Robust software security contributes to overall business stability and growth by enhancing client trust, guaranteeing regulatory compliance, and protecting the company's reputation.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Making sure all third-party dependencies were current and free of known vulnerabilities was the most difficult aspect of the vulnerability evaluation. The OWASP Dependency Check plugin had to be carefully examined and incorporated into the build procedure in order to accomplish this. But this approach was also very beneficial because it greatly enhanced the application's security posture and automated the detection of possible threats.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I added SHA-256 checksums for data integrity, HTTPS for client-server communication, and the OWASP Dependency Check to check for dependency vulnerabilities in order to strengthen the security layers of Artemis Financial's application. By taking these steps, the security posture was improved and industry standards were met. In addition to static and dynamic analysis, threat modeling, frequent security audits, and continuous security training, I would employ automated tools like OWASP Dependency Check, SonarQube, and Snyk to evaluate vulnerabilities in the future. This all-encompassing strategy guarantees strong security and efficient vulnerability mitigation.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I carried out in-depth code evaluations and extensive testing to guarantee the application was secure and operational. I refactored the code and then utilized static and dynamic analysis, as well as automated tools like the OWASP Dependency Check, to find any new vulnerabilities. This approach guaranteed the application's continued stability, security, and dependability.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

A number of tools, resources, and coding techniques proved to be very helpful for upcoming assignments or tasks. In order to automatically check dependencies for vulnerabilities and guarantee the security of third-party libraries, the OWASP Dependency Check was crucial. To secure communications and safeguard data while it was in transit, SSL/TLS certificate configuration was essential for turning on HTTPS. By using SHA-256 checksums, data integrity was confirmed, guaranteeing that the data was reliable and unchanged. Thorough testing, which included functional, integration, and unit tests, was essential for confirming the behavior of the application and identifying problems early. Potential security vulnerabilities were found by using static and dynamic analysis tools to examine code both statically (for coding errors) and dynamically (for runtime vulnerabilities). By carrying out in-depth code reviews, possible security flaws were identified and recommended practices were followed.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I can demonstrate my abilities to improve software security and guarantee operation with this job. This entails creating SHA-256 checksums for data integrity, incorporating the OWASP Dependency Check for vulnerability screening, and putting HTTPS into practice to protect communication. In addition to participating in extensive code reviews and security audits, I carried out extensive testing, including unit, integration, and functional tests. These samples showcase my value as a competent and experienced professional by showcasing my expertise in secure coding methods, vulnerability evaluation, and producing reliable software solutions.
